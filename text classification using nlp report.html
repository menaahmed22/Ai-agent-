            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Text classification, a core NLP task, involves assigning predefined categories to text data.  This is achieved through various techniques, including preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stop word removal), vectorization (converting text into numerical representations like TF-IDF or word embeddings), and applying machine learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, etc.). Deep learning models like CNNs and LSTMs offer advanced approaches for capturing contextual information.</p>
